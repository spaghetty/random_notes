In a big IT department, verify that the new architecture is implemented correctly in all the corner of the system is quite challenging topic due to the high parallelism within the organization.

## How do we deal with architectural evolution

Applying some principles from evolutionary architecture, emerging architecture and google SRE approach seems to lead to a valid approach in order to achieve a distributed architectural effort.

A need for an architecture emerge within the day by day experiment happening in all the teams, the more valuable idea is to collect those experiment and try to standardize the ones that perform better.

Apply a strict observability in order to measure the system in all is parts is the basic enabler for introducing the fitness functions concept presented in the topic of evolutionary architecture.

Having a team that is totally focused on those metrics useful for describing the system allows you to form some champions (engineer totally focused on this matter) that can support product oriented teams(that are more focused on business results of their work) in order to improve their performance in those specific metrics as soon as they start to go down (as expressed into the SRE strategy)

Sharing the knowledge and coaching the engineering community is mandatory in order to avoid useless effort and polarize the efforts toward a specific direction, an approach in this direction is having public repository where all the engineer can discuss on best practices that need to be embedded in our development model making them accepted from all the members.
