After the new tech radar were released a lot of discussion arise about what exactly mean to manage a platform team as a product team

In my personal opinion the real game changer are the objectives the team is trying to reach.

Usually a platform team is purely technical one and the common approach is to bring them a well defined technical challenge:

* ```a faster pipeline```
* ```more reliable network```

the point is how do you define that the missing peace is one of those component and how do define the success.

In the traditional approach the needed evolution is mainly driven by gut filing of some manager or better an architect, and the requirement for the success follow the same flow.


sometimes happen that ```the surgery succeeded but the patient died```. What does this means, the team reach all is targets but probably the decision was wrong.

When you start considering how a product really work, you understand that the evolution of a product is not so mathematically defined, the user perception of slowness can be related on how the page work or other subtle and even unrelated factors that bother the user.

As a consequence of this a lot of effort is invested in "discovery" as mean for understanding what really moves the user perception, in order to guide the discovery phase in the right direction a lot have been done in the product field in order to guarantee the team autonomy and a lean approach.

So what do we have in the product approach on evolving a product is a clear discovery phase based on fast experimenting and results evaluation and a clear definition of the objective for the team.

If as a strategy I want to get more users ask for more users and not a faster product.

The same should apply to teams that are building a platform, define what is your business objective and assign that objective to a platform team that contains all the required skill for experimenting in order to find the right solution.
